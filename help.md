## Common issues & fixes


#### Maps installation?
 * Head to the collections page either in your steam client or the web page (while logged in) and subscribe to the list.
 * After subscribing to the list, select the "+Subscribe to all" to sub to all the individual maps
 * Optionally favourite the collection to make it easier to find later.
 * With L4D2 closed, Steam should see the changes and install a workshop update, wait for it to complete.
 * Once done, open your game client and wait in the main menu for the game to scan and update your workshop addons (may take some time - multiple minutes for the first run, 10-90s for smaller updates)
 * After the addons have completed loading, join the lobby or close your game for later games.

#### Local install location?
 * Workshop maps automatically go in to `..\steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\addons\workshop` and NOT `..\left4dead2\addons`.
 * If you have any duplicate, conflicting or differently sourced copies of workshop maps in the parent `\addons` folder best to delete/move them to make life easier on yourself.

#### Installed addons missing or lobby asking you to download?
 * After a new subscribe/install allow Steam to complete any workshop Downloads _before_ starting your game client.
 * After opening your game, allow the client to scan, update and load your addons *before joining a lobby* (10-60 secs in menu).

#### Addons list shows many addon conflicts?
 * Multi-part maps often conflict with themselves since they duplicate some assets or apply the exact same tweaks.
 * You can ignore warnings on maps you know you don't have duplicated in `\addons`.
 * Conflicts with other _non-map_ installed addons however should be investigated or the extra addons disabled for compatability/consistency reasons (if they're blocking you from connecting).

#### Can we play *this* map?
 * Have a campaign you want to try out, send it @shen or @indiv for inclusion
 * Ideally try it out yourself first to make sure its not completely broken and of a good enough quality to bother.
 * We prefer Steam Workshop hosted maps but can add other, manual sources if its not available via the workshop.
